## Self-hosted email with Nextcloud? Look no further! Federated Computer has you covered.

If you've got a web domain for your business or personal use and don't want to use Google or Microsoft for email, the options can be daunting and expensive. We know. We started using Nextcloud internally, then realized most hosting services for email are offered separately. Go figure!

Not only did we want Nextcloud and email bundled but we also wanted it to be more economical than Google ($15 per user per month!) So, we decided to bundle these services as "Federated Core" and offer it to the public. 

For $39 per month for a team of 10 people, you get email and Nextcloud plus VPN, Matrix for secure team chat (Slack replacement), Jitsi (Google Meet replacement) and more! Use what you want.

Replace Google, Zoom, Slack, 1Password, Github, crappy VPN with a 100% private solution, no corporate surveillance.

If you're looking to self-host your email server and have sys admin chops, you might check out Umbrel or Start9. They offer sweet hardware devices for $800-1000; otherwise Federated Core is your best best for a 100% private VM instance for which you control the keys, not us.
