* **[Human Support](/support)** means you don't have to search around or trust in the benevolence of a message board to find the solution to your questions.
* **The Experience of Federated** ensures smooth sailing since Federated is made from the people who invented cloud computing, node.js, cloud operating systems, large scale high-availability, and launched companies like Twitter, Facebook Developer Program, Linkedin, Tumblr, and many others.
