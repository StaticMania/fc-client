Federated Computer documentation can be found **[at this link](https://documentation.federated.computer)**.

Federated Computer offers an open-source documentation project where customers and collaborators can work with Federated Computer folks to document how to use the various software components best for work, team collaboration, with desktop and mobile devices, etc.

This documentation was written for the end-user. We will be publishing a further set of documentation once we open-source our stack and you can install Federated Computer on your own hardward or cloud server.
