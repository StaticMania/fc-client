We never want to leaving you searching a website, fumbling around Reddit, or throwing questions into the dark hole of Telegram looking for an answer or solution. The Customer is the most important person in the Federated galaxy, so we offer you a number of ways to get the support you need!

### Support Options

We've got lots of ways we can stay in touch and get all the wrinkles, questions, comments ironed out and answered.

**Documentation**

We offer a complete set of documenation geared to end-users and administrator. Please visit the [Federated Documentation Project](https://documentation.federated.computer).

**Support System**

Do you need support with your installation? Maybe you want to ask a question before purchase? Click one of the following three options to route your question properly...

1. **[I am an existing customer.]( https://support.federated.computer/help/849966676 )** (support@federated.computer)

2. **[I have a question or issue before I become a customer.](https://support.federated.computer/help/1169049282)** (sales@federated.computer)

3. **[I want to talk with someone at Federated about something else.]( https://support.federated.computer/help/3687502689 )** (info@federated.computer)

Don't worry, you can't make a wrong choice.

**Telephone**

We're still a small company, but sometimes going back and forth on email or messaging just doesn't cut-the-mustard. So give us a call and we **will** call you back to get your issue sorted as soon as possible. Call Federated Computer at: +1-970-722-8715.

**Twitter** and **Nostr**

We love when people engage with us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/federatedworld) or [Nostr]().
