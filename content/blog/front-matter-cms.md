## A CMS that works with Federated Core

Federated Core has a workflow allowing customers to create static-file websites, publish them to their private Gitea repository, and auto-publish to their private Caddy webserver. Front Matter supports this workflow beautifully...

It runs inside of Visual Studio Code among other tools allowing you to preview and create great content using Federated Core.
