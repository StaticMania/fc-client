## What can self-sovereign individuals learn from Bitcoin maxis?

We love Bitcoin maxis because they give the self-sovereign individual

[21 Rules of a Bitcoin Maxi](https://darthcoin.substack.com/p/21-rules-of-a-bitcoin-maxi)

Let's see how these some of these rules can be applied to the self-sovereign individual even if, horror, they have no interest in Bitcoin.

1. Not your keys. This is the principal of decentralization. We don't use centralized services where are data is not our own.
2. Stack sats. For the self-sovereign, this means moving data from fiat services to decentralized and continuing to use and accumulate data on decentralized services.
4. No one needs to know how much bitcoin you have. Likewise, why advertise how you're accomplishing your digital freedom using decentralized tools?
5. Run your own node. In the end, if you don't run it, our have "joint" custody so that you can take it over, it's not your data.
6. Don't do shitcoining. When you interact with friends deep in the Google, Apple, Facebook, etc ecosystems, you're kissing up to shitcoiners. Maybe you need new friends?
7. Back up your wallet seed words. There are great ways to preserve your sovreignty through backups.
13. Bitcoin changes you. When you commit to the self-sovereign lifestyle, you change from "can I do this, please, sir?" to "I did this." It is life-changing.
14. Bitcoin teaches you to be a champion of truth. Here "truth" means living authentically under the principle that only you can be responsible for yourself and those you love. The "state" or the "corporation" do not have your "truth" in mind.
18. Always fight FUD. Most will say this lifestyle is not possible.

Together we can change our world.
