## You think your Telegram Data is Secure?

If the thing you're using is centralized, it is so much easier for the "authorities" to compel disclosure of data. Case in point is Telegram who was recently forced to disclose names, phone numbers, and IP address accused of sharing material thought to infringe copyright.

The court order was issued by the Delhi High Court in India and required Telegram to disclose the information to the plaintiffs who had filed a copyright infringement case against the users.

It is important to note that this action was taken in compliance with a specific court order and does not necessarily indicate a general policy or practice of Telegram to disclose user information. Telegram has previously stated that it values the privacy of its users and that it will only disclose user data in response to a valid court order or other legal requirement.
