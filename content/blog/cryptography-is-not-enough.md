According to the article published by Dergigi, cryptography alone is not sufficient to provide complete security for digital systems and data. While cryptography is an essential tool for protecting data against unauthorized access and tampering, it cannot address all of the security challenges that digital systems face.

The article notes that cryptography is vulnerable to various attacks, including brute force attacks, side-channel attacks, and quantum attacks, which could potentially compromise the security of encrypted data. Additionally, cryptography cannot protect against other types of security threats, such as social engineering attacks, insider threats, and physical attacks on hardware and infrastructure.

The report argues that a comprehensive approach to security is necessary, which includes not only cryptography but also other security measures such as access control, authentication, monitoring, and incident response. The article also highlights the importance of regular security audits and updates, as well as ongoing education and training for users to promote awareness of security best practices.

The article notes that as digital systems become increasingly complex and interconnected, the need for a comprehensive security approach becomes even more important. It also highlights the potential risks of relying solely on cryptography for security, and the need for organizations and individuals to adopt a more holistic approach to protecting their data and systems.
