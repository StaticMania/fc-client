So... Take action. Get off the metadata supply wagon. "But I'm not a threat to the US security establishment." No, likely not. But you're of interest to Mark Zuckerberg and his establishment. You may be alive, but he wants to sell you those most comfortable ever lounging shoes if it's the last think he does. And Google, also interested. So interested they use your simple metadata to follow you around town like a benvolent advertising deity. Real God, help us!
