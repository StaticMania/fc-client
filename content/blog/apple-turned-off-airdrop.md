## What does it mean when a vendor tells you how to use tools on your device?

Apple made a change to how AirDrop works in mainland China restricting the way Apple customer could communicate with each other.

According to the article published by Reclaim The Net on August 10, 2021, Apple has come under scrutiny for allegedly allowing Chinese users to receive unsolicited content through its AirDrop feature. The report states that Chinese users have been receiving unsolicited pornographic images and spam through AirDrop from strangers who are using anonymous usernames.

The article further notes that the Chinese government has been cracking down on online pornography and other forms of illegal content, and the use of anonymous usernames has been banned in the country. However, the report suggests that the anonymity feature of AirDrop has allowed users to bypass this regulation and share illegal content.

Apple has not yet commented on the matter, but the report raises concerns about the company's responsibility to prevent the spread of illegal content and protect its users from unwanted and potentially harmful material. It also highlights the challenges faced by tech companies operating in China, where strict government censorship and regulation often conflict with international standards of free speech and privacy.
