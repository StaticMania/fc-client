## Inttroducing Redecentralize

At Federated we support any organization fighting against digital monopolies, surveillance capitalism, and a lack of self-sovreignty.

Redecentralize is an organization seeking "a world of open platforms and protocols with real choices of applications and services for people. We care about privacy, transparency and autonomy. Our organizations and tools should fundamentally be accountable and resilient." Amen.
