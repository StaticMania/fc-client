## NSA Seeks to Track Bitcoin Users

In a story from the annals of the obvious... But why? They might as well haul in the whole village looking for the one villager who committed the *alledged* crime.

The National Security Agency (NSA) worked to track down users of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin by analyzing internet traffic and other data sources, according to documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

The documents suggest that the NSA was interested in identifying Bitcoin users who may be engaged in illegal activities such as money laundering and drug trafficking. The agency reportedly used its surveillance capabilities to monitor Bitcoin users' internet traffic, as well as other data sources such as financial transactions and social media activity, in an attempt to identify individuals involved in criminal activity.

The article notes that while the NSA's interest in Bitcoin users may have been motivated by a desire to combat illegal activity, it also raises concerns about government surveillance and privacy rights. Some critics argue that the NSA's actions represent an overreach of its surveillance powers and a violation of individuals' privacy, particularly given the largely unregulated nature of the cryptocurrency market.

It's important to note that the documents cited in the article are from 2013, and it's unclear whether the NSA's activities in relation to Bitcoin users have continued or evolved since then.
