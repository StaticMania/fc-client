## New calendar design

Thunderbird is getting better and better. Among many of the FOSS reasons to use Thunderbird, it's possible to set up Thunrderbird so that your settings move from machine to machine. Nice! But the integrated calendar was always sub-par. Looks like a future update named "Supernova" will fix that.
