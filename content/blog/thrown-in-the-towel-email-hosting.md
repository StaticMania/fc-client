## The challenges faced by those seeking to self-host email

Is it true self-hosting email is a lost cause? Carlos F. seems to think so.

The purpose of this post isn't to be an *apologia* for self-hosting email. Rather, it is to highlight the oligarchic behaviors that exist on certain protocols (smtp, etc) and to say that we encourage this behavior when we give up and move to more niche protocols (eg nostr?) In the end, *they*, the *Centralizers* own the network. It can be done.
