According to a thread on the MacRumors forums, some users of iCloud for Windows have reported experiencing issues with the service, including corrupted videos and downloading other people's photos.

The thread includes reports from users who have experienced issues with iCloud for Windows, such as videos that are downloaded from iCloud being corrupted and unplayable, and photos that belong to other iCloud users being downloaded to their own devices. Some users have also reported that their files and folders have been deleted from iCloud without their knowledge or consent.

The issue appears to be affecting a small number of users, and there is no clear consensus on the cause of the problem. Some users have speculated that it may be related to a recent update to iCloud for Windows, while others suggest that it may be related to conflicts with other software or hardware on their devices.

Apple has not yet issued a statement regarding the issue, but some users have reported success in resolving the problem by uninstalling and reinstalling iCloud for Windows or by resetting their iCloud account. However, the reports highlight the potential risks of relying on cloud-based services for storing and sharing important files and data, and the need for users to regularly back up their data and be aware of potential security and privacy issues.
