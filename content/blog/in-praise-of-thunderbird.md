### Email is Important

In today's digital world, email remains a cornerstone of communication for individuals and businesses alike. But with concerns about privacy, security, and dependence on big tech, many are seeking alternatives that align with their values. Enter Thunderbird, the open-source email client that has been revolutionizing the way we interact with our inboxes. In this article, we will explore Thunderbird's top features, shed light on its remarkable development journey, and emphasize the importance of using open-source software for a more secure and customizable email experience.

Email is an ancient service and, often left in the dustbin, the clients that support email are often left to digitally rot. Email service providers have embraced and extended email (example: Gmail) or decided they won't receive email from unknown email servers from unknown domain *unless* paid tens of thousands of dollars per month to "ensure" delivery. It's a racket and a scam.

Email is important to how the internet works. It is a universal service, owned by no one, capable of being delivered to almost any computing platform today from watches, to desktops, to phones, to tablets, to TVs and cars.

We need to protect and nuture email!

### "Modern" Thunderbird is Great

One of the applications continuing to innovate in an open and free way is Thunderbird. While in the past, under the neglect of the Mozilla Foundation, Thunderbird did *not* get the attention it deserves, it is now being maintained and improved in important ways. The team there is redesigning the application from the ground up to be very responsive, handle email, calendar, contacts, chat in a nice, unified interface.
