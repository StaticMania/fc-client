Self-ownership means "anonymity" and to "communicate securly with anyone on the planet without being observed by a third party". Of course, there are a number of parts to this puzzle. The hardware, the client software and operating system, the server hardware, software and operating system, and then the network and the means of utilizing that network. Each have their own challenges to "ownership" and incumbent third-parties such as Google, Apple, Microsoft, the NSA, five eyes, and all the rest who have built lucrative and oppressive business models on maintaining that observation.

We stand today naked before our computing overlords. Only when we begin to clothe and cloak bit by bit do we begin to take away control from the peeping Toms, the creeps, the "authorities".
