According to an article published by Zero Hedge, some major tax filing services in the US have been sending users' financial information, including their social security numbers and income details, to Facebook through tracking tools on their websites.

The article states that tax filing services such as TurboTax, H&R Block, and TaxAct have been using tracking tools from Facebook and other third-party companies on their websites, which allow them to collect data on users' browsing behavior and interests. This data is then used to target users with personalized advertising on Facebook and other platforms.

The report raises concerns about the potential security and privacy implications of this practice, as sensitive financial information could be vulnerable to hacking or misuse by third parties. It also highlights the need for users to be aware of the data collection practices of the websites and apps they use, and to take steps to protect their personal information, such as using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication.

The article notes that TurboTax, H&R Block, and TaxAct have all stated that they do not sell users' personal information, and that they take measures to protect users' data. However, the use of tracking tools on their websites has raised questions about their commitment to user privacy and security.
