## Drowning in AI Generated Garbage

It's a contrarian opinion to opine that AI is anything but garbage (i.e. something written by a 5th grader doing a report). Look, we use ChatGPT to generate the summaries for these link list posts, because we are lazy, and we want to spend more time PC gaming. We're old school that way. But most of the summaries require a significant amount of re-writing...so how lazy are we after all?

Here's the AI speaking...

Discusses the proliferation of low-quality, AI-generated content on the internet and the challenges it poses for consumers and content creators alike.

The author notes that while AI-generated content can be useful in certain contexts, such as language translation or image recognition, it can also be used to create vast quantities of low-quality content such as spam emails, fake reviews, and clickbait articles.

(Clickbait articles? Hell, yes! This part was created by a human because, despite what the "consensus" might say, AI doesn't have a sense of attempted humor.)

This flood of low-quality content can make it difficult for consumers to find trustworthy information and can undermine the credibility of legitimate content creators.

(Human here, again. Difficult to find trustworthy information? Yes, because it is just re-gurgitating the internet!)

The article also highlights the potential for AI-generated content to be used in more nefarious ways, such as the creation of deepfakes or the manipulation of social media algorithms to spread disinformation.

The author argues that addressing the problem of AI-generated content will require a multi-faceted approach that involves both technical solutions and broader societal changes. For example, platforms could implement more robust content moderation and verification processes, while consumers could become more discerning in their online consumption habits and more willing to pay for high-quality content.

Overall, the article underscores the need for continued scrutiny of the impact of AI on society and for thoughtful approaches to managing its potential downsides.
