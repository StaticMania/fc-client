## Slack? $72 per month for a team of 10 people!

Slack is a centralized service and locks you in to a closed system.

You could instead own your company's data and run it 100% privately on your own virtual machine on Matrix with Federated Computer for only $39 per month.

Leave the Slack silo behind and get:

1. Unlimited private and public rooms
2. Fully encrypted
3. Single-sign on (SSO)
4. Element is the free client-side app that works with Matrix available for Windows, Mac, Linux desktop and Android/iOS
5. Video and voice chat

Matrix is part of Federated Core which also includes email hosting, VPN (Wireguard), Nextcloud, Baserow (Airtable clone), and more! Use what you want.

If you're entrenched in Slack, don't fret! Migration is simple: https://element.io/blog/slack-migration/

The Element wizard (software from Element) will migrate a complete Slack Workspace including all users, public channels, messages and files.
